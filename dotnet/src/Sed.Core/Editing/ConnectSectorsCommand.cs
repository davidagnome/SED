/// Joins two overlapping sectors into a portalled set (`ConnectSectors` in

/// Two sectors that overlap describe the same volume twice, which the engine
/// cannot render. Connecting them:
/// 1. cleaves each sector by every face plane of the other, so the overlap
///    becomes its own piece and the remainders split off as new sectors;
/// 2. adjoins each of the first sector's faces to a coincident face among those
///    new pieces, turning the shared boundaries into portals;
/// 3. deletes the second sector, whose remaining piece *is* the duplicated
///    overlap volume.
///
/// Built entirely from existing reversible commands — <see cref="CleaveSectorCommand"/>,
/// <see cref="MakeAdjoinCommand"/>, <see cref="DeleteSectorCommand"/> — so undo
/// is just replaying them backwards, and each step stays individually tested.
